# LIBS for an Improved Quantification of Aluminium Alloys
## Objective 
<div "text-align:justify">This research focuses on developing Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for an improved identification and quantification of aluminium alloys. 
The study was limited to at least five elements commonly found in aluminium alloys. These elements included copper, manganese, magnesium, silicon, and zinc. 
All measurements were carried out at room temperature at Helios Lab+ Helmholtz Institute for Resource Technology, Freiberg, Germany. The scope of the research included the following:</div>
